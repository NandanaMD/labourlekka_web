## Introduction

Labour Lekka ("we", "our", or "the App") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Labour Lekka mobile application.

By installing or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.

## Nature of the Application

Labour Lekka is a fully offline, local-only application designed to help users manage labour attendance, wages, and related records.

- The App does not require an internet connection for core functionality.
- The App does not operate backend servers.
- The App does not sync or transmit data externally.

---

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, access, store, transmit, or process any personal or non-personal data on our servers.

Specifically, we do not:

- Collect personal information for storage on our servers
- Track user activity with analytics
- Display advertisements or share data with advertisers
- Sell or monetize user data

---

## Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores information only on your device, as entered by you. This may include:

- Worker details (names, phone numbers, addresses)
- Attendance records and work hours
- Wage payments and advance records
- Contractor details and work categories
- Reports, summaries, and exported files generated by the user

All such data remains under your control and stays on your device unless you choose to export or back it up.

---

## How the Information Is Used

Local data is used only to enable app functionality, including:

- Recording and managing labour attendance
- Calculating wages and payments
- Generating reports and summaries
- Creating local backups or export files on your device

The App does not use this information for any other purpose.

---

## Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored locally on your device using the device’s storage mechanisms.
- No data is uploaded, synced, or transmitted over the internet by the App.
- Optional security features such as app lock (PIN/biometric) may be available to protect local data.

While we implement reasonable safeguards, the security of your data also depends on how you secure your device.

---

## Backups and Exports

Any backups or exported files (for example, Excel or PDF) are created locally on your device at your request. We do not access, manage, or control exported files — securing those files is your responsibility.

---

## User Responsibility

All information entered into the App is provided by the user voluntarily. Users are responsible for:

- Ensuring the accuracy and legality of entered data
- Complying with applicable laws and regulations
- Securing exported or backed-up files

We disclaim liability arising from misuse, incorrect data entry, or legal consequences related to stored data.

---

## Data Deletion

You have full control over your data. To remove all app data:

1. Open the App
2. Go to Settings > App Management
3. Select "Reset App"

Uninstalling the App also permanently removes all locally stored data.

## Children’s Privacy

Labour Lekka is intended for business and professional use and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with third-party services that access user data (analytics, advertising, cloud storage, social media, tracking tools, etc.).

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
